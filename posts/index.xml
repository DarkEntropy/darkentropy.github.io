<p>Dark Entropy&rsquo;s core raid is intended to be a quasi-competitive raid group. Guild members who are part of this raid group will need to earn their keep, and are expected to be consistent performers who show up prepared, work as a team, and are able to constructively help others. The composition of this raid, and the raiders therein, will be dependent on guild needs and are based on performance over FOTM. Put directly, we&rsquo;re bringing the player over the class - we might need a Boomkin, but if the presence of that player is a net less compared to a less meta-friendly Mage, we will likely bring the Mage.</p>
<p>While we absolutely want Dark Entropy to be a home for all of our community, this group aims to be among the top raid groups on the server and as such everyone needs to pull their weight and give 100%.</p>
<h1 id="alt-raidsoffnight-content">Alt raids/Offnight content</h1>
<p>We will also be hosting off-night events from time to time (Zul&rsquo;Aman, old content, etc&hellip;), and in may cases these will also be open to alts and our more casual guild members as long as a solid group can be put together.</p>

Our goal is to clear all current content as rapidly as is reasonably possible upon release and to be competetive in progression with the top guilds on our server.
The guild consists largely of old friends from early retail WoW. We want to provide a friendly environment and home for all of our players, but participation in the core raid team will be based exclusively on class/role needs and performance.</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="dark-entropys-mission-statement">Dark Entropy&rsquo;s Mission Statement</h1>
<p>Dark Entropy aims to provide a fun, welcoming  atmosphere and serious raiding environment for our players.</p>
<p>Our goal is to clear all current content as rapidly as is reasonably possible upon release and to be competetive in progression with the top guilds on our server.</p>
<p>The guild consists largely of old friends from early retail WoW. We want to provide a friendly environment and home for all of our players, but participation in the core raid team will be based exclusively on class/role needs and performance.</p>
<p>We require appropriate consumable usage (potions, flasks, food, etcâ€¦) and it is appreciated when people bring extras of these to raids.</p>
<p>Our raid times are 8PM to ~11:30PM (sometimes Midnight during progression) server time, Thursday and Friday. Invites start at 7:30PM with the expectation that we can pull at 8PM. We may occasionally schedule off-night raids for content like Zul&rsquo;Aman, older content, etc&hellip; however these are not mandatory.</p>
<p>We ask that our players show up to raids prepared with consumables, knowing their class, boss strategies, and to remain present and attentive during our 6-8 hours of raiding per week.</p>
<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<h3 id="raider-expectations">Raider Expectations:</h3>
<h4 id="conduct">Conduct</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be communicative and involved in the guild.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep yourself up to date with all announcements on discord and the repo.</li>
<li>Help out guildmates whenever you can by running 5-man groups, providing crafting services, etc&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>RESPECT ALL OF YOUR GUILDMATES AND OTHERS.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are of course not obligated to socialize with anyone in the guild, though it is recommended and encouraged. However, you ARE obligated to be cordial and respectful to everyone in the guild.</li>
<li>Do not harass, demean, or abuse your guildmates.</li>

<li>Do not under any circumstances have anyone on Discord muted or on <code>/ignore</code> during raids.</li>
<li>Keep criticism constructive!
<ul>
<li>We are working to cultivate a collaborative environment to support continued improvement, so please maintain good faith when communicating areas of improvement to your guildmates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep NSFW discussion and content to the designated channels.
<ul>
<li>Note: Discussion of political topics is discouraged outside of designated channels due to the potential for conflict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Act with maturity and respect when representing your guild in public.</p>
<ul>
<li>This includes public forums, general chat in WoW, tells with people outside the guild, parties you may be in outside the guild, and guild applications.</li>
<li>Do not flame other people, do not spam, do not ninja loot, do not grief your own faction.</li>
<li>In general do not present yourself as a jerk. Doing so reflects poorly on the rest of us.</li>
<li>If you cannot curb yourself you may be asked to edit/delete your posts, apologize to people you have offended, etc&hellip; or potentially be removed from the guild.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="performance">Performance</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Always be prepared for raiding and focused on progression.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are expected to do what it takes to perform to the best of your abilities.</li>
<li>You must obtain BIS gear outside of raid content where needed (e.g crafted/rep pieces).</li>
<li>You are expected to take the time out of your day to farm the consumables that you&rsquo;ll need during raids. We all have jobs/families/school and understand that time is limited. If you need help with consumables there are many in the guild willing to do so.</li>
<li>You are expected to be prepared with knowledge of encounters. This content is old and largely solved so strategies, videos, and resources are widely available. During the raid is not the time to provide lectures on boss mechanics and strategies beyond a refresher/course correction.</li>
<li>Use appropriate addons. RCLC and Bigwigs/DBM are required, but others might be necessary for you to fulfill your duties during raid.</li>
<li>Be on voice during raids, have a working microphone and use it appropriately for communication during raids.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be present and attentive during raids.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistently confirm your attendance availability in Discord signups before the raid (ASAP after signups are posted).</li>
<li>Be reliably available for all required raid nights (currently Friday/Saturday).</li>
<li>Do not go AFK repeatedly or for extended periods during raids. We are all humans, we understand emergencies and IRL obligations, but please be communicative about any absences or required breaks so we can plan accordingly.</li>
<li>Donâ€™t die to avoidable mechanics (don&rsquo;t stand in the fire).</li>
<li>Be online and available for raids at, or very shortly after, invite time (7:30PM server time) whenever possible.</li>
<li>We will have a sit rotation for most classes/roles - if it is your turn on the bench, please be available to come in if needed. If you need to use this time for other things please communicate with your scheduling officer.</li>
<li>Be present and participate when appropriate in class/role-specific commutation channels, such as in-game and discord class/role channels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work towards continued improvement</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct proper study and research of theorycrafting and best practices for your class</li>
<li>Utilize logs, vods and any other appropriate tool for postmortem analysis to identify areas of improvement for yourself</li>
<li>Accept good-faith criticism from guildmates and guild leadership and work to address any issues identified by others</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="raider-demotion-expectations">Raider Demotion Expectations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Low performance will be addressed by the Officers, with the goal of helping the Raider improve their performance.</li>
<li>If continued low performance, inattentiveness, showing up unprepared, repeated AFKing, etcâ€¦, continue after counseling, then the Raider will be replaced.</li>
<li>If the replaced Raider wishes to return to Raider status, they will go through a new trial period as a probation.</li>
