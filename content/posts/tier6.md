# Tier 6 Content Cleared!

Congrats to Dark Entropy for clearing all of tier 6, and a big thank you to all of our raiders for showing up prepared and ready to rock!

- Archimonde down January 27th
- Illidan down February 4th

Once we got our SR together (silly Heart of Darkness RNG) cleanup from Mother onwards was a breeze!
