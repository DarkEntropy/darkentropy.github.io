# Core Raid Team

Dark Entropy's core raid is intended to be a quasi-competitive raid group. Guild members who are part of this raid group will need to earn their keep, and are expected to be consistent performers who show up prepared, work as a team, and are able to constructively help others. The composition of this raid, and the raiders therein, will be dependent on guild needs and are based on performance over FOTM. Put directly, we're bringing the player over the class - we might need a Boomkin, but if the presence of that player is a net less compared to a less meta-friendly Mage, we will likely bring the Mage.

While we absolutely want Dark Entropy to be a home for all of our community, this group aims to be among the top raid groups on the server and as such everyone needs to pull their weight and give 100%.

# Alt raids/Offnight content

We will also be hosting off-night events from time to time (Zul'Aman, old content, etc...), and in may cases these will also be open to alts and our more casual guild members as long as a solid group can be put together.
