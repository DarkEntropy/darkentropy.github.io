# Core Raid Team

Dark Entropy's Core raid (RAID-CORE) is intended to be a quasi-competitive raid group. Guild members who are part of this raid group will need to earn their keep, and are expected to be consistent performers who show up prepared, work as a team, and are able to constructively help others. The composition of this raid, and the raiders therein, will be dependant on guild needs and are based on performance over FOTM. Put directly, we're bringing the player over the class - we might need a Boomkin, but if the presence of that player is a net less compared to a less meta-friendly Mage, we will likely bring the Mage.

While we absolutely want Dark Entropy to be a home for all of our community, this group aims to be among the top raid groups on the server and as such everyone needs to pull their weight and give 100%.

# Second Raid Team

Dark Entropy supports a second raid team (RAID-B) in addition to our core raid team (RAID-CORE). The second team provides the following benefits:
- A mechanism for our casual players, friends and family, and alts to raid. 
- A feeder for RAID-CORE: when we inevitably lose players from RAID-CORE we can bring promising candidates up from RAID-B.

The framework for RAID-B will be as follows:
- RAID-B will be largely autonomous.
- Loot will be distributed via simple rolling system that requires no maintenance (e.g. +1).
- Raid times will be determined based on availability of participating players. 
- Recruiting for RAID-B will be conducted as needed to ensure healthy attendance and composition.
- The officers will designate one or more official Raid Leaders for RAID-B. 
	- RL will have the same responsibilities as RAID-CORE raid leader
	- RL will be responsible for conducting the raid in a pleasant and effective manner.
	- RL can delegate tasks as needed but will be responsible for the results. 
	
Additional notes
- RAID-B will in no circumstances be allowed to negatively impact the success or performance of RAID-CORE.
- RAID-B is inteded to provide a casual, but focused environment for those not in RAID-CORE.
- No loot prio for RAID-CORE members attending a RAID-B raid.
