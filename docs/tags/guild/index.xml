      <description>Dark Entropy&amp;rsquo;s Mission Statement Dark Entropy aims to provide a fun atmosphere and serious raiding environment for our players.
Our goal is to clear all current content as rapidly as is reasonably possible upon release.
The guild consists largely of old friends from early retail WoW. We want to provide a friendly environment and home for all of our players, but participation in the core raid team will be based exclusively on class/role needs and performance.</description>

      <description>Dark Entropy Loot System Dark Entropy uses a Loot Council system for loot distribution in the core raid.
  Loot will be distributed by the officers as seen fit.
  Loot distribution will be based on a variety of factors including but not limited to:
 Performance in raids Preparedness Attendance Conduct Raid needs (e.g. tank gear prio)    We will make an effort to provide a reasonable level of transparency to the Loot Council process.</description>
