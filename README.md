# This repo powers the guild website

Uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). 

To do updates: 
- Clone the repo
- Update the files needed (`config.toml` for the landing page, `content/posts/*.md` for anything under "About")
- Push your changes, and the website will be updated automatically (after a rebuild, which can take a few minutes)
