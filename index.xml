Guild members who are part of this raid group will need to earn their keep, and are expected to be consistent performers who show up prepared, work as a team, and are able to constructively help others. The composition of this raid, and the raiders therein, will be dependent on guild needs and are based on performance over FOTM.</description></item><item><title>Guild Charter</title><link>https://darkentropy.github.io/posts/guildcharter/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://darkentropy.github.io/posts/guildcharter/</guid><description>Dark Entropy&amp;rsquo;s Mission Statement Dark Entropy aims to provide a fun, welcoming atmosphere and serious raiding environment for our players.
Our goal is to clear all current content as rapidly as is reasonably possible upon release and to be competetive in progression with the top guilds on our server.
The guild consists largely of old friends from early retail WoW. We want to provide a friendly environment and home for all of our players, but participation in the core raid team will be based exclusively on class/role needs and performance.</description></item><item><title>Loot System</title><link>https://darkentropy.github.io/posts/loot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://darkentropy.github.io/posts/loot/</guid><description>Dark Entropy Loot System Dark Entropy uses a Loot Council system for loot distribution in 25-man content.
Loot will be distributed by the officers as seen fit.
Loot distribution will be based on a variety of factors including but not limited to:
Performance in raids Preparedness Attendance Conduct Raid needs (e.g. tank gear prio) We make an effort to provide a reasonable level of transparency to the Loot Council process.</description></item></channel></rss>
